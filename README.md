## Introduction

This repository includes two jupyter notebooks showcasing neural networks' ability to add and multiply numbers. I have filled the notebooks with plenty of commentary so that you can see what's happening at each step even if you don't run the code. I like to explain stuff as I go on so that I myself can learn while I do stuff, instead of brainlessly typing code without knowing what's happening. Doing addition and multiplication is simple but I was fascinated by how the neural networks were able to learn what to do without me *explicitly telling them what to do*. 

## Jupyter Installation

You can check these notebooks without having Jupyter Notebook installed but you won't be able to modify or run any of the code in them. Regardless, these notebooks have the outputs saved from the last time I ran the code, so you should be able to see them. However, if you would like to get your hands dirty maybe because this intrigued you, feel free to install [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) by running `pip install jupyter-lab` and then once installed, running it using `jupyter-lab` on your terminal.

## Contents

I recommend you look at the addition NN (Neural Network) before you make your way to the multiplication NN. I wish I could go into more details here what is happening in each notebook but that would just spoil the fun. So, have a look. Jupyter Notebook makes it very pretty to be able to read the code.
